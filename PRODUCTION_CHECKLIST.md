### Quick Deploy Commands:

#### For Vercel:
```bash
npx vercel login
npx vercel
# Follow prompts and add MONGODB_URI environment variable
```

#### For Netlify:
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
netlify deploy --build
# Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard
```

### MongoDB Atlas Production Setup:
1. Go to Network Access → Add IP Address → Allow Access from Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
2. Database Access → Ensure user has readWrite permissions
3. Copy connection string for MONGODB_URI environment variable
